# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN-
This project is a deep learning-based tool designed to classify breast cancer histopathology images as benign or malignant. It was built using the BreakHis v1 dataset, which contains 7,909 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue collected from 82 patients. These images are labeled as either benign or malignant and span four magnification levels: 40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X â€” making the classification task particularly challenging due to visual variations across zoom levels.
EfficientNetB2 is the backbone of the model. EfficientNet is a family of CNNs known for achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters by scaling depth, width, and resolution efficiently and in a balanced way.
The model was trained in two phases. In the first phase, only the top layers were trained while the EfficientNet base remained frozen. In the second phase, selected layers of the EfficientNet model were unfrozen and fine-tuned at a lower learning rate to further improve accuracy. The training was conducted on Kaggle using an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU.
The trained model was deployed using Streamlit. This web interface allows users to upload a histopathology image and receive an instant prediction (benign or malignant), along with a confidence score.
